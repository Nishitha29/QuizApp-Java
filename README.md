# 🧠 Java Console Quiz App

A simple Java-based console application that presents a 5-question quiz, captures user responses, and calculates a score based on correct answers. This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, arrays, class interaction, and user input handling.
